        <h2>Prometheus Heats Things Up</h2>
        <p>
          Prometheus did not care to live amid the clouds on the mountain top.
          He was too busy for that. While the Mighty Folk were spending their
          time in idleness, drinking nectar and eating ambrosia, he was intent
          upon plans for making the world wiser and better than it had ever been
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went out amongst men to live with them and help them. Ah, how very
          poor and wretched they were! He found them living in caves and in
          holes of the earth, shivering with the cold because there was no fire,
          dying of starvation, hunted by wild beasts and by one another-the most
          miserable of all living creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If they only had fire," said Prometheus to himself, "they could at
          least warm themselves and cook their food; and after a while they
          could learn to make tools and build themselves houses. Without fire,
          they are worse off than the beasts."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he went boldly to Jupiter and begged him to give fire to men,
          that so they might have a little comfort through the long, dreary
          months of winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not a spark will I give," said Jupiter. "No, indeed! Why, if men had
          fire they might become strong and wise like ourselves, and after a
          while they would drive us out of our kingdom. It is best for them to
          be poor and ignorant, that so we Mighty Ones may thrive and be happy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Prometheus made no answer; but he had set his heart on helping
          mankind, and he did not give up. He turned away, and left Jupiter and
          his mighty company forever.
        </p>

        <p>
          As he was walking by the shore of the sea he found a reed, or, as some
          say, a tall stalk of fennel, growing; and when he had broken it off he
          saw that its hollow center was filled with a dry, soft pith which
          would burn slowly and keep on fire a long time. He took the long stalk
          in his hands, and started with it towards the dwelling of the sun in
          the far east.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mankind shall have fire in spite of the tyrant who sits on the
          mountain top," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reached the place of the sun in the early morning just as the
          glowing, golden orb was rising from the earth and beginning his daily
          journey through the sky. He touched the end of the long reed to the
          flames, and the dry pith caught on fire and burned slowly. He called
          some of the shivering men from their caves and built a fire for them,
          and showed them how to warm themselves by it and how to build other
          fires from the coals. Soon there was a cheerful blaze in every rude
          home in the land, and men and women gathered round it and were warm
          and happy, and thankful to Prometheus for the wonderful gift which he
          had brought to them from the sun.
