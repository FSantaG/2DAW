    <h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>

    This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to
    see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!

    <h2>Pozzarello</h2>

      View from the bedroom window The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello
      and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who
      tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice
      and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view
      from our bedroom window.

    <h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>

      View of the rolling tuscan hills This is the scene on the way to
      Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene
      on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We
      were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.

    <h2>Sienna</h2>

      />

      View from the bedroom window The closest city to our villa was Sienna,
      about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked
      streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping
      in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.
